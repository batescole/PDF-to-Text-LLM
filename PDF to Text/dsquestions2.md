### Question 1


Question Type: MultipleChoice


Which Web Application Firewall (WAF) service component must be configured to allow, block, or
log network requests when they meet specified criteria?

###### Options:


A- Protection rules

B- Bot Management

C- Origin

D- Web Application Firewall policy

###### Answer:


A

###### Explanation:


Detailed Answer in Step-by-Step Solution:


Objective: Identify the WAF component that controls request actions based on criteria.


Understand WAF Components:


Protection Rules: Define conditions and actions (e.g., allow, block, log).


Bot Management: Handles bot traffic, not general request rules.


Origin: Backend server endpoint, not rule-based.


WAF Policy: Umbrella config, but rules specify actions.


Evaluate Options:


A: Protection rules---Set specific criteria and actions---correct.


B: Bot Management---Bot-specific, not general requests.


C: Origin---Defines source, not actions.


D: WAF policy---Broad config, not the granular rules.


Reasoning: Protection rules directly manage request behavior---fit the requirement.


Conclusion: A is correct.


_**Explore Oracle 1Z0-1110-25 Questions By Greer - Page 3**_


OCI documentation states: ''Protection rules (A) in WAF define conditions (e.g., IP, URL) and

actions (allow, block, log) for incoming requests.'' Bot Management (B) targets bots, Origin (C) is
a target server, and WAF Policy (D) encompasses rules but isn't the action specifier---only A
aligns with OCI's WAF configuration.
