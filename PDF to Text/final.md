### Question 7
Question Type: MultipleChoice
On which option do you set Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Budget?
###### Options:
A- Compartments
B- Instances
C- Free-form tags
D- Tenancy
###### Answer:
D
###### Explanation:
Detailed Answer in Step-by-Step Solution:
Objective: Determine where OCI budgets are set.
Understand Budgets: Track spending across OCI resources.
Evaluate Options:
A: Compartments---Scoped within tenancy, not budget root.
B: Instances---Specific resources, not budget scope.
C: Tags---Filter costs, not budget setting.
D: Tenancy---Top-level scope for budgets---correct.
Reasoning: Budgets apply at tenancy, optionally filtered (e.g., by compartment).
Conclusion: D is correct.
_**Real Oracle 1Z0-1110-25 Study Questions By Fuentes - Page 9**_
OCI documentation states: ''Budgets are set at the tenancy level (D), with optional filters like
compartments or tags to monitor spending.'' A, B, and C are sub-elements---only D is the primary
scope per OCI's cost management.
: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cost Management Documentation, 'Setting Budgets'.
### Question 8
Question Type: MultipleChoice
Which is NOT a compliance document?
###### Options:
A- Certificate
B- Penetration test report
C- Attestation
D- Bridge letter
###### Answer:
B
###### Explanation:
Detailed Answer in Step-by-Step Solution:
Objective: Identify a non-compliance document in OCI context.
Understand Compliance Docs: Formal attestations of adherence (e.g., SOC, ISO).
Evaluate Options:
A: Certificate---Proof of compliance (e.g., ISO)---compliance doc.
B: Pen test report---Security test result, not formal compliance---correct.
C: Attestation---Statement of compliance---compliance doc.
D: Bridge letter---Links audit periods---compliance doc.
Reasoning: B is operational, not a compliance artifact.
Conclusion: B is correct.
_**Real Oracle 1Z0-1110-25 Study Questions By Fuentes - Page 10**_
OCI documentation lists ''compliance documents like certificates (A), attestations (C), and bridge
letters (D) for standards like SOC or ISO; penetration test reports (B) are security assessments,
not formal compliance docs.'' Only B stands apart per OCI's compliance terminology.
: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compliance Documentation, 'Compliance Artifacts'.
### Question 9
Question Type: MultipleChoice
Which cache rules criterion matches if the concatenation of the requested URL path and query
are identical to the contents of the value field?
###### Options:
A- URL_PART_CONTAINS
B- URL_IS
C- URL_PART_ENDS_WITH
D- URL_STARTS_WITH
###### Answer:
B
###### Explanation:
Detailed Answer in Step-by-Step Solution:
Objective: Match a cache rule criterion for exact URL path and query.
Understand Cache Rules: Used in OCI (e.g., WAF, CDN) to cache content.
Evaluate Options:
A: Contains---Partial match, not exact.
B: Is---Exact match of full URL (path + query)---correct.
C: Ends with---Matches end, not full URL.
D: Starts with---Matches start, not full URL.
Reasoning: ''URL_IS'' checks exact equality---fits requirement.
_**Real Oracle 1Z0-1110-25 Study Questions By Fuentes - Page 11**_
Conclusion: B is correct.
OCI documentation states: ''The URL_IS (B) criterion in cache rules matches when the full URL
(path and query) exactly equals the specified value.'' A, C, and D are partial matches---only B
ensures identical concatenation per OCI's caching config.
: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure WAF Documentation, 'Cache Rules Criteria'.
### Question 10
Question Type: MultipleChoice
Which statement is true about standards?
###### Options:
A- They may be audited
B- They are the result of a regulation or contractual requirement or an industry requirement
C- They are methods and instructions on how to maintain or accomplish the directives of the
policy
D- They are the foundation of corporate governance
###### Answer:
A
###### Explanation:
Detailed Answer in Step-by-Step Solution:
Objective: Identify a true statement about standards in an OCI context (likely
governance/security).
Understand Standards: Rules or benchmarks, often compliance-related.
Evaluate Options:
A: Auditable---True; standards are checked for adherence.
B: Result of requirements---Partially true, but not always.
C: Methods/instructions---More procedural, not defining standards.
D: Foundation of governance---Broad, not specific to standards.
_**Real Oracle 1Z0-1110-25 Study Questions By Fuentes - Page 12**_
Reasoning: A is universally true---standards face audits (e.g., SOC, ISO).
Conclusion: A is correct.
OCI documentation notes: ''Standards (e.g., security standards) may be audited (A) to ensure
compliance with OCI policies or external regulations.'' B is a source, C describes procedures, D is
too vague---only A is consistently true per OCI's compliance framework.
