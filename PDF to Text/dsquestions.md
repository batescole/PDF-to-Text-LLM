to an image

B- Adding a single label to an image

C- Adding labels to an image by drawing a bounding box to an image is not supported by Data

Labeling

D- Adding labels to an image using object detection, by drawing bounding boxes to an image

E- Adding multiple labels to an image

###### Answer:


B, D, E

###### Explanation:


Detailed Answer in Step-by-Step Solution:


Objective: Identify three annotation methods in OCI Data Labeling for images.


Understand Data Labeling: Supports image annotations for ML.


_**Free Oracle 1Z0-1110-25 Exam Questions By Simpson - Page 6**_

B: Single label (classification)---Supported---correct.


C: No bounding boxes---False; boxes are supported.


D: Object detection with boxes---Supported---correct.


E: Multiple labels (multi-label)---Supported---correct.


Reasoning: B (classification), D (detection), E (multi-label) match OCI capabilities.


Conclusion: B, D, E are correct.


OCI documentation states: ''Data Labeling supports image annotations via single-label
classification (B), object detection with bounding boxes (D), and multi-label classification (E).'' A
misdefines segmentation, C contradicts support---only B, D, E are valid per OCI's Data Labeling

features.
