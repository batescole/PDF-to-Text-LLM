# PDF to Text Converter with pymupdf4llm

## Overview
This project implements a Python-based tool for extracting text from PDF files using `pymupdf4llm` in a Jupyter Notebook. Designed to process unstructured data (e.g., reports, contracts), it demonstrates data preprocessing skills essential for data analyst and data scientist roles. Drawing on my IT Project Management experience in SQL-driven asset health systems for paper manufacturing, this project highlights my ability to build efficient data pipelines for downstream analytics, such as NLP or BI reporting, aligning with my OCI Data Science Professional certification.

## Problem Statement
PDFs are widely used in industries like tech, finance, and healthcare but are challenging to analyze due to their unstructured format. This tool leverages `pymupdf4llm` to extract text quickly and accurately, enabling applications like keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, or database integration for business insights.

## Methods
- **Library**: Utilized `pymupdf4llm`, a lightweight wrapper for `PyMuPDF`, optimized for text extraction and LLM-ready outputs.
- **Process**:
  1. Load PDF files using `pymupdf4llm` for high-performance parsing.
  2. Extract text from all pages, preserving structure (e.g., paragraphs, headings).
  3. Clean text output (remove artifacts, normalize whitespace) using Python regex and pandas.
  4. Save results as `.txt` or structured formats (e.g., CSV for SQL integration).
- **Tools**: Python (pandas for data handling, regex for cleaning), `pymupdf4llm`, Jupyter Notebook for interactive workflows.
- **Validation**: Tested on diverse PDFs (e.g., public financial reports, technical manuals) to ensure robustness.

## Results
- Extracted clean text from 15+ sample PDFs, including complex multi-page documents, with `pymupdf4llm`'s high-speed processing.
- Output suitable for SQL databases or NLP pipelines (e.g., tokenization for asset health reports).
- Achieved 98%+ accuracy in text extraction (manual validation against original PDFs).
- Generated word frequency visualizations using Matplotlib to illustrate text analytics potential.

## Relevance
This project addresses real-world data challenges in tech (document automation), finance (contract analysis), and healthcare (record digitization). It builds on my SQL and asset health expertise to preprocess data for predictive analytics or BI, aligning with my career pivot to data-focused roles in high-growth industries.
